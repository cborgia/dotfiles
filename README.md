# My Dotfiles

How it get up and go on a fresh install of OS X... 


Current as of _Feb, 20 2016_

* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for shell management (tweaks to the bootstrap)
* .osx (after fresh install of OS X)
* .brew (after fresh install of OS X)
* .functions



## How it works
I do not edit the dotfiles directly in my home directory. Instead I edit a repo I store in `~/Projects/Dotfiles` and run the bootstrap file when I need to push changes to my home directory.


## Files not included:
* .shuttle.json - I use [shuttle](http://fitztrev.github.io/shuttle/) to quickly SSH into servers, no need to share that info here.


## To DO
* add cmatrix feature on terminal boot
* eidt vi and tmux configs to be super awesome!
* move to a symlink system for easier updating and managment
