# cborgia Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, they are currently undergoing a rewrite, based on the idea of a Module Based Directory Structure.

### Module Based Directory Structure

The `mods` directory is a collection of directories -each directory within holds one or more files, that relate to each other. This allows for easier management whereby each module can have it's own setup file, shell environment file and symbolic links. The idea of modules was borrowed from the "topics" that [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) has in his dotfiles.


### To Do:


* [x] Allow for 2 Workflows: an `Initial Workflow` for the initial install and setup of new machine, and an `Ongoing Workflow` for ongoing updates and modifications.
* [ ] Support both MacOS and Linux.
* [ ] User configurable from a single configuration file.
* [ ] Allow for the setup of private (ignored) configs



*Inspiration for this setup provided by the dotfiles of several others: [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), [driesvints](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) and [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).*
