# My Dotfiles

Current as of _August 9, 2015_

* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for shell management (tweaks to the bootstrap)
* .osx (useful after HD formats)
* .brew (useful after HD Formats
* .functions


## How it works
I do not edit the dotfiles directly in my home directory. Instead I edit a repo I store in `~/Projects/Dotfiles` and run the bootstrap file when I need to push changes to my home directory.

## Some unique stuff I do

**Multiple Alias Files:**  I no longer do this

**Path Management:** I prefer my path to be easily readable, so there is a path file and each path is on it's own line.


## Files not included:
* .shuttle.json - I use [shuttle](http://fitztrev.github.io/shuttle/) to quickly SSH into servers.


## To DO
* add cmatrix feature on terminal boot
* fine tune bootstrap file
